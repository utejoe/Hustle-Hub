Exactly — introducing **user roles with levels** is the right way to scale an app like this. Here’s a smart breakdown of common user roles and what each should be responsible for in your **Campus Hustle** platform:

### 🔑 Recommended User Role Levels

| Role              | Description                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Super Admin**   | Full control over the entire platform. Can manage all users, roles, schools, listings, payments, etc.   |
| **Admin**         | Platform-wide access to moderate listings, manage users, but cannot delete Super Admins.                |
| **Moderator**     | Assigned to a specific school. Can approve/reject listings only from that school.                       |
| **Editor**        | Content manager. Can edit or update listings/content but not approve/reject or delete.                  |
| **Vendor (User)** | Default user role. Can post listings, manage their own services.                                        |
| **Buyer (User)**  | Default user role. Can browse, chat, and place orders. (Same as vendor but hasn't listed anything yet). |

### 🧩 Suggested Schema Update (Admin/User Model)

#### For **Admin.js**:

```js
const adminSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true }, // hashed
  role: {
    type: String,
    enum: ["superadmin", "admin", "moderator", "editor"],
    default: "moderator"
  },
  moderatedSchool: { type: String } // only for moderators
});
```

#### For **User.js** (optional enhancement):

```js
role: {
  type: String,
  enum: ["vendor", "buyer"],
  default: "buyer"
},
```

### ✅ Next Steps:

1. **Update your `Admin.js` model** to include role + moderated school.
2. Add **role checks** in your middleware.
3. Refactor the `/admin/approve/:id` and `/reject/:id` routes to use these roles.
4. Add logic in the frontend to show/hide features based on role.

Would you like me to generate:

* The updated `Admin.js` model with full roles?
* Middleware to enforce role access?
* Updated `/approve/:id` route?

Let’s do it step by step.
